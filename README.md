# Face_Mask_Detection

A working Deep Learning model to classify images of person with or without mask.

Ths model can be deployed for detecting whether a person is wearing a mask or not in order to warn if it is a "Face Mask Zone" area.

The model is trained using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which consists of input layers fed into a convulational block followed by a dense layers, finally giving the output.
